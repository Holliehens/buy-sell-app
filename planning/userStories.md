# User Stories

## As a user...
- I can see the featured items upon coming to the main feed, because I want to be able to see what the sellers believe are the most interesting items for sale
- I want to be able to favourite items I have interest on, because I want to defer my decision on whether or not I will purchase later
- I want to be able to message sellers in-app that have listed items that I have interest in, because I want to be able to negotiate deals with them

## As an admin...
- I want to be able to post items, so that I can interest buyers with my wares
- I want to be able to remove items, because I have decided that they are no longer actively being sold
- I want to be able to mark a listing as SOLD, to indicate that the item has been sold to a buyer
- I want to be able to reply to in-app to inquiries from prospective buyers
